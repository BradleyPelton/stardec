### Major renaming
# Celestial Body vs Celestial Object. Not the same thing.


An astronomical object or celestial object is a naturally occurring physical entity, association, or structure that exists in the observable universe.
astronomical body or celestial body is a single, tightly bound, contiguous entity,

 while an astronomical or celestial object is a complex, less cohesively bound structure, which may consist of multiple bodies or even other objects with substructures.
